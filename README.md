# Project directory
## This project constructed an integrated forecasting method using neural networks for short-term financial data and hybrid ARIMA for long-term dataã€‚
## For short-term data, the evaluated models are as follows
* LSTM (100 units)
* LSTM (200 units)
* Bi-directional LSTM (100 units)
* CNN
* CNN-LSTM
* CNN-BiLSTM
* CNN-BiLSTM-AM
## For long-term data, the evaluated models are as follows
* ARIMA-LSTM
## A Final Report was presented with details in the file
